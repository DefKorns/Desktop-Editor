# DEFKORNS - ORIGINAL DESKTOP EDITOR

This application was based on hakchi2 by clusterM and the module was based on both hmods already available viral_dna's (a.k.a DNA64) - SNES Original Boxart Patch & DanTheMan827's - custom_boxart.hmod

 This allows you to change the box art and info for the "original" games.

Install and synchronize games.

Enjoy!
